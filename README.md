## Clear: 
Delete a specific animal

## Eat: 
Requests an integer and increases the energy level of that animal according to this value up to its maximum.<br>
Food allows the animal to move, when the animal runs out of energy it will stop. Animals are initially initialized without energy and therefore need to be fed.<br>
